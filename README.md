This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## NOTE:
In order to actually hit the OpenAI API, you need to generate an API key. There is a [quick start page here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart) that will provide you with a link to create you API key.
Also make sure you aware of which model you are going to use when making the API calls. There are instances in the repo where `model` is referenced, so make sure you set that to the appropriate model per your subscription.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject-www`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

This is a thin wrapper around create-react-app's `eject` command. There is currently not an `eject` option for create-node-app.
